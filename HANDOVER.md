# Fulcrum — Handover

> Snapshot at branch `feat/agent-foundation-clean` (HEAD `0ca8b88`, local branch 1 commit ahead of `origin/feat/agent-foundation-clean`). Forward-looking only — historical event logs pruned. For archaeology: `git log` and per-commit messages.

## 0. Destination

**Fulcrum is a local-first CLI Agent OS for supervising repositories, tasks, agent runs, context, memory, and artifacts.**

Today the foundation layer is partly in place. Supervisor / task / agent-runs / context-engine / memory / artifacts / plugins layers are placeholders, not implementations. Remaining ship work is listed in §6. See `AGENTS.md` for the trajectory framing.

---

## 1. Current state — one paragraph

`feat/agent-foundation-clean` currently provides a Bun `fulcrum` CLI with project init, hook subcommands, hook config registration, hook snippet vending, rules splicing, non-destructive uninstall, in-repo skill sync during install, pinned curated upstream skill sync, DeepWiki MCP registration, caveman install, caveman compression, doctor, and local CI. 28 in-repo skills are lint-clean, caveman-compressed (`.original.md` beside each), and pass the latest Claude/Codex eval bar. Eight hook recipes (`format`, `lint-gate`, `pm-policy`, `test-on-edit`, `audit-log`, `index-check`, `index-rebuild`, `tool-output-router`) are TypeScript subcommands of the same binary. `src/agents/registry.ts` is the single source of truth for all 5 agent definitions consumed by install, doctor, and skills. No GitHub Actions are wired (intentional; opt-out). Remaining pre-PR work is the ship gate in §6: run full CI, scratch install/uninstall smoke, then open a fresh PR from this branch.

## 2. Architecture

```
fulcrum (Bun binary; ~60–120 MB per platform)
├── fulcrum hook <name>     — 8 subcommands invoked via stdin JSON envelopes
│     • index-check, index-rebuild       (session lifecycle)
│     • format, lint-gate, test-on-edit  (PostToolUse Write|Edit)
│     • pm-policy                        (PreToolUse Bash)
│     • audit-log                        (PostToolUse Bash)
│     • tool-output-router               (PostToolUse any) — TOML-driven
│
├── fulcrum init [DIR]      — bootstrap project AGENTS.md + .claude/CLAUDE.md
├── fulcrum install [--with-project DIR] [--no-skills] [--no-upstream-skills]
│                            — sentinel-splice rules, vendor snippets, seed policy,
│                              caveman per-agent install, caveman ultra lock,
│                              sync authored + curated upstream skills unless opted out,
│                              register DeepWiki MCP for supported detected agents
├── fulcrum uninstall [--dry-run] [--purge] [--include-caveman]
│                            — remove Fulcrum-managed rules blocks, hook configs/state,
│                              authored/upstream skill namespaces, generated
│                              Gemini import, unmodified policy; caveman only with flag
├── fulcrum hooks list/enable/disable
│                            — edit detected agent hook configs + marker state
├── fulcrum skills sync     — fan out to <agent>/skills/fulcrum/<name>/
├── fulcrum skills upstream — fan out curated upstream skills to <agent>/skills/fulcrum-upstream/<name>/
├── fulcrum skills lint     — frontmatter + body section structure
├── fulcrum skills list     — inventory + eval coverage
├── fulcrum compress        — compress in-repo content via caveman CLI; --check for CI
└── fulcrum doctor          — bun, agent dirs, caveman section (with defaultMode), 32 tools, policy; --json flag
```

Three agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) call `fulcrum hook <name>` directly from native hook config. Two (OpenCode, Pi) load TypeScript shims from `shims/{opencode,pi}/fulcrum.ts` that re-dispatch to the same binary.

## 3. What works (verified)

- `bun run ci` — green in the latest local run: install + tsc + 108 tests (12 files, 196 expect calls) + 5 platform builds + skills:lint (28/28) + compress:check (soft, 0 pending).
- `bun run scripts/build-all.ts` — 5 targets (`darwin-arm64` 63 MB, `darwin-x64` 68 MB, `linux-x64`/`linux-arm64` ~101 MB, `windows-x64` 118 MB).
- `bash scripts/install.sh` — splices rules, vendors snippets, seeds policy. Idempotent. `FULCRUM_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z` fetches a prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases.
- `bun run release vX.Y.Z [--gh]` — clean-tree gate → CI → CHANGELOG → tag → cross-compile → optional `gh release create`. Does NOT push.
- `fulcrum install` — 8 steps: rules spliced into Claude Code / Codex CLI / OpenCode / Gemini; policy seeded; caveman per-agent; `~/.config/caveman/config.json` written `{"defaultMode":"ultra"}`; authored in-repo skills synced unless `--no-skills`; curated upstream skills synced unless `--no-upstream-skills`; DeepWiki MCP registered for supported detected agents. Respects `--dry-run`.
- `fulcrum uninstall` — removes Fulcrum-managed rules blocks, native hook registrations, hook snippets/markers, managed `skills/fulcrum/` and `skills/fulcrum-upstream/` namespaces, Gemini managed skill extensions, generated Gemini import, and unmodified seeded policy. Keeps edited policy by default and keeps caveman unless `--include-caveman`.
- `fulcrum skills upstream` — reads `skills/upstream.lock`, checks out pinned upstream SHAs into `~/.fulcrum/cache/upstream-skills`, and installs 20 selected skills under `fulcrum-upstream/` (Gemini: `fulcrum-upstream-skills` extension).
- `fulcrum hooks enable/disable` — registers/removes native configs for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Pi CLI; records/removes intent markers; still prints registration snippets for review.
- `fulcrum doctor [--json]` — 32/32 tools detected; "Caveman" section with `defaultMode` display; `DoctorReport` JSON on `--json`.
- `assertNotAgentsPath()` / `lockCavemanUltra()` — hard guards in install.ts; both tested.
- `fulcrum skills sync` — all 28 compressed skills under `<agent>/skills/fulcrum/<name>/`.
- `fulcrum init <dir>` — seeds AGENTS.md, `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md` import), `.gitignore`.
- Format-hook smoke: piped a malformed `.py` Edit envelope → ruff rewrote it correctly.
- `scripts/eval-skill-claude.sh <skill> --runs-per-query 1` — confirmed with new match-words + data-rich queries. jq: 83/0 on `/tmp/jq-sanity4` (baseline was 66/12). Auth via Claude Code keychain — no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `bun run compress -- --check` / `scripts/eval-all.sh --regenerate-only` — both verified.
- `src/agents/registry.ts` — canonical `AGENTS` array; no inline agent configs scattered across files.

## 4. Decisions on the record

Don't relitigate without new information.

| Decision | Why | Where |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript via Bun, not Rust/Go | OpenCode/Pi shims must be TS. Unifies the codebase and matches 3 of 5 peer-agent runtimes. | `package.json`, `src/` |
| Sentinel-block rules splice | Works on every agent regardless of `@import` support; idempotent; preserves user content. | `src/cli/install.ts`, BEGIN/END FULCRUM RULES markers |
| Hook recipes ship as binary subcommands | One source of truth; snippets reference `fulcrum hook <name>`. | `src/hooks/`, `hooks/recipes/*.snippet.md` |
| Skills install under `<agent-skills-root>/fulcrum/<name>/` | Path-based namespace; sets up the `fulcrum:<skill-name>` address space for the future plugin layer. | `src/cli/skills.ts` (NAMESPACE constant) |
| Skill `name:` stays prefix-free | Slash command stays short (`/jq`, not `/fulcrum:jq`); namespace is the parent dir. | `docs/skills.md` §4 |
| Eval harness uses `claude` CLI, not the Anthropic SDK | Auth lives in the OS keychain. Execution path matches how a real session loads a skill. | `scripts/eval-skill-claude.sh` |
| No GitHub Actions | Local `bun run ci` and `bun run release` are the gates. Future workflows must be additive. | absence of `.github/workflows/` |
| One tool, one skill | Exception: tightly-coupled CLIs (`dart format` + `dart analyze` → `dart-toolchain`). | `skills/SOURCES.md`, AGENTS.md |
| Skill content correctness is NOT implied by lint | Lint verifies frontmatter shape + body structure. Content must be verified against upstream at authoring time. | `AGENTS.md`, fix commit `08101c6` |
| Caveman ultra mandatory always-on | ~75% output-token reduction; `rules/AGENTS.md` §0b is the contract; `~/.config/caveman/config.json` is the runtime lock. | `rules/AGENTS.md` §0b, `lockCavemanUltra()` |
| Never use `~/.agents/` for skills | Shared folder pollutes every agent's context; `assertNotAgentsPath()` enforces this at runtime. | `src/cli/install.ts`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| Agent registry as single source of truth | Without a registry, agent defs drifted independently in install, doctor, and skills. | `src/agents/registry.ts` |
| Caveman compression of in-repo content is part of CI | Verbose skills waste tokens every session; soft-fail gate prevents accidental uncompressed commits. | `scripts/compress-with-caveman.sh`, `scripts/ci.ts` |
| Per-skill iteration over batch leaderboard tuning | Batch runs confound measurement between skills; one skill at a time is the safe unit. | `scripts/eval-skill-{claude,codex}.sh` |

```

Branch should stay on `feat/agent-foundation-clean` for now. PR #1 was closed because the branch is not ready to merge. Do not open a new PR until §6 is cleared.

---

## 6. Remaining work — ship gate

The implementation/docs blockers from the previous queue are cleared: hook registration edits native configs, upstream skills are pinned in `skills/upstream.lock`, third-party support is documented as filesystem skill install, `repomix` is no longer promised as an upstream install, capabilities are bring-your-own tools, DeepWiki is the only managed default MCP, and the skill smoke docs cover Claude and Codex trigger-rate harnesses.

Before opening a fresh PR:

1. Run `bun run ci`.
2. Re-run the scratch install/uninstall smoke in §7.
3. Open a fresh PR from `feat/agent-foundation-clean`.

Release can happen only after merge to `main` via `bun run release vX.Y.Z [--gh]`.

## 7. Smoke-test recipes

Run from repo root with `PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` (or a similarly broad PATH).

```bash
# 1. Type-check, tests, build, lint — single gate
bun run ci

# 2. Cross-compile sanity
bun run scripts/build-all.ts

# 3. End-to-end install into a scratch HOME (non-destructive; includes DeepWiki MCP)
SCRATCH=$(mktemp -d)
HOME=$SCRATCH PATH="$SCRATCH/.local/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" mkdir -p \
  $SCRATCH/.local/bin $SCRATCH/.claude $SCRATCH/.codex \
  $SCRATCH/.config/opencode $SCRATCH/.pi/agent $SCRATCH/.gemini
echo "PRE-EXISTING USER CONTENT" > $SCRATCH/.claude/CLAUDE.md
HOME=$SCRATCH PATH="$SCRATCH/.local/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" \
  bash scripts/install.sh
HOME=$SCRATCH fulcrum doctor
head -3 $SCRATCH/.claude/CLAUDE.md   # confirm user content preserved
rm -rf $SCRATCH

# 4. Install smoke with authored skills disabled
SCRATCH=$(mktemp -d)
HOME=$SCRATCH PATH="$SCRATCH/.local/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" \

rm -rf $SCRATCH

# 5. Install smoke with upstream skills disabled

rm -rf $SCRATCH

# 7. Uninstall smoke

scripts/eval-skill-codex.sh jq --model <codex-model>

# 9. Doctor JSON output
fulcrum doctor --json | jq .verdict
# expect: "ok", "warning", or "error"
```

## 8. Known limitations (current)

- **Trigger-rate eval exists for Claude Code and Codex only.** No equivalent harness for Gemini / OpenCode / Pi; those remain manual smoke.
- **Uninstall is conservative.** It does not remove caveman by default and keeps modified policy files unless `--purge`.
- **Third-party upstream sync uses repo-level pins.** `skills/upstream.lock` pins reviewed repository SHAs and metadata. It does not pin each subpath independently.
- **DeepWiki is the only managed default MCP.** Other MCPs remain opt-in.
- **Claude Code MCP removal is manual.** Install can call `claude mcp add`, but uninstall prints `claude mcp remove -s user deepwiki` instead of invoking it.
- **OpenCode is archived** (2025-09-18). Successor: Charm's Crush. `shims/opencode/fulcrum.ts` is written against last-stable OpenCode; Crush's plugin contract may differ.
- **Pi has no MCP support** by design. Tier rules keyed `mcp__*` will never fire on Pi (`docs/agents.md` §5.6).
- **`dist/` is gitignored.** Every fresh clone needs Bun to run `bash scripts/install.sh` (or set `FULCRUM_RELEASE_TAG=...` to fetch a release artifact).
- **Skill content correctness is the author's job.** Lint passes do not imply upstream-correct content. Fix commit `08101c6` corrected 19 skills after the fact; future authoring should verify inline.
- **Caveman ultra is mandatory but not enforced for new skills.** Any new `SKILL.md` added without a compression pass will deploy verbose content. Run `/caveman:compress skills/<name>/SKILL.md` before committing.
